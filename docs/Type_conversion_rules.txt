Arithmetic and comparison operations will convert types if needed. If operands have different types, following rules are checked until a match is found. If no match is found, a type error is raised.

	If one argument is double and other is either float or integer, the float\integer is promoted to double.
	If one argument is float and another is integer, the integer operand is promoted to float.	Otherwise a TypeError is raised.
